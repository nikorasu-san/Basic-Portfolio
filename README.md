### Basic-Portfolio
This is my mock portfolio created for NU Bootcamp Homework.

## Callouts    

# About Us Page

* Attempted to jazz this page up with some external links. 
* The links in text and the nav bar should change to teal on hover status. 
* I removed the underline in the nav bar to match the mock up screenshots.

#Contact US Page

* The button changes color when clicked, but no other action. Clicks do nothing.

* Message field is using a <textarea> element so that its size can be manipulated by the viewer.


# Portfolio Page

* The placeholder thumbnnails don't click to new locations. Hover status changes the opacity for the thumbnails.

* There is a scroll option for main content, but both Firefox and Chrome appear to auto-hide the scroll eventhough it is using code to show it by default.
